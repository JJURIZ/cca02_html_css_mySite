                <h1>Cat-A-Log Item: Chloe</h1>
                <p>Chloe was a beautiful longhair calico my wife found at Pensacola Junior College. She therefore was always referred to as the "educated cat".</p>
                <p>Chloe mixed well with the cats we had and the ones that came after her. She had a great disposition as evidenced by all the photos we have of her sleeping with other cats. </p>

               Chloe was the first cat I didn't want but ended up with anyway.  
                <ul>
                    <li>Generally sweet but could get fiesty.</li>
                    <li>Was a great balance between sweetness and cat-itude.</li>
                </ul>
