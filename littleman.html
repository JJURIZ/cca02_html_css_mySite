                <h1>Cat-A-Log Item: Little Man</h1>
                <p>Little Man was a wee guy when we got him.</p>
                <p>It was late afternoon and we stopped by a pet store to get a collar for one of our dogs. We walked up right as they were closing and right as a pair of military men were attempting to give a two week old kitten to the employee. She refused. They asked us and of course we said yes. </p>
                <p>His eyes weren't even open yet. That was nearly 19 years ago. As of this writing (late 2019) he's still with us.</p>
                <p>He is unquestionably the strangest cat we've owned. He's had several behavior unsolvable behaior issues. But then he will also sweetly lie on my chest before bed.</p>
